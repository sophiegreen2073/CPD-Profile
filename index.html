                My name is Sophie Green, I am a 24 years old and studying Msc Robotics at the University of Manchester. I have a Bsc in Maths and Computer Science also from the University of Manchester that I obtained in 2022. I have spent three years working as a Software Developer, focusing on warehouse automation and simulation at a manufacturing company.

        <p style="font-size:30px">Career Goals</p>        
        I would love to continue working in software, but move towards a more robotics focused career. I am particularly interested in medical robotics as they are on the cutting edge of innovation and are helping improve health all around the world.

        <div class="LeftThird">
            I created a MES system for an automated labelling line, labelling full bags of pet food. This was a bespoke solution, incorporating Universal Robots, cameras with build in deep learning models and PLCs for controlling the individual components

        <div class="MiddleThird">
            I am working on an ongoing simulation of an automated packing hall for packing dry pet food into bags. This includes simulating the new version of the distribution warehouse. I used Emulate3D, reading CAD designs and outputting throughput numbers to support the design process.

            I have been working on a group project in my master's degree, building a Leo Rover with a manipulator arm to retrieve coloured blocks and place them in a bin of the same colour
